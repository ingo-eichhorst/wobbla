They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone.

Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:<name> --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke <name>  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge <rig>/polecats/<name> \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: <polecat> stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat <name> reports stuck.
