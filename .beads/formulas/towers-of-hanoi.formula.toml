AGENT EXECUTION PROTOCOL - Towers of Hanoi

PURPOSE: This is a durability proof, not computation. Steps are pre-computed.
Your job is to execute them mechanically, proving crash-recovery at scale.

EXECUTION LOOP:
1. Find current state: bd mol current <mol-id>
2. Find the next ready (unblocked) step
3. Close it: bd close <step-id>
4. Repeat until no ready steps remain

ON RESUME (after crash/restart/handoff):
- Same as fresh start. The molecule IS the state.
- Query `bd mol current <mol-id>`, continue from there.
- No memory of previous session needed.

DO:
- Close steps as fast as possible (they're trivial mechanical moves)
- Use `gt handoff` when context fills (proactive cycling)
- Trust the pre-computed solution - every move is already correct

DO NOT:
- Try to solve Hanoi yourself - moves are already computed
- Mark steps in_progress - just close them directly
- Ask for permission - this is GUPP territory, just execute
- Stop for human input - run autonomously until complete

MONITORING:
- Progress: Count closed children of the molecule
- For mega-molecules: Use convoy dashboard when available
- Completion: All steps closed = molecule complete

This proves Gas Town can execute arbitrarily long workflows with
nondeterministic idempotence - different sessions, same outcome.
