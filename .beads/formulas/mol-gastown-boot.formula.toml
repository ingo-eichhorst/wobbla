Mayor bootstraps Gas Town via a verification-gated lifecycle molecule.

## Purpose
When Mayor executes \"boot up gas town\", this proto provides the workflow.
Each step has action + verification - steps stay open until outcome is confirmed.

## Key Principles
1. **Verification-gated steps** - Not \"command ran\" but \"outcome confirmed\"
2. **gt peek for verification** - Capture session output to detect stalls
3. **gt nudge for recovery** - Reliable message delivery to unstick agents
4. **Parallel where possible** - Witnesses and refineries can start in parallel
5. **Ephemeral execution** - Boot is a wisp, squashed to digest after completion

## Execution
```bash
bd mol wisp mol-gastown-boot  # Create wisp
```"""

Verify the Gas Town daemon is running.

## Action
```bash
gt daemon status || gt daemon start
```

## Verify
1. Daemon PID file exists: `~/.gt/daemon.pid`
2. Process is alive: `kill -0 $(cat ~/.gt/daemon.pid)`
3. Daemon responds: `gt daemon status` returns success

## OnFail
Cannot start daemon. Log error and continue - some commands work without daemon."""
