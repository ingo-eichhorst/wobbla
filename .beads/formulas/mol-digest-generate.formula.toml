Generate daily digest for overseer (Mayor).

Dogs work through molecules (poured from this formula) on a scheduled basis (daily, or triggered by plugin)
to create summary digests of Gas Town activity. This aggregates:
- Work completed across all rigs
- Issues filed and closed
- Incidents and escalations
- Agent health metrics
- Key statistics and trends

## Dog Contract

This is infrastructure work. You:
1. Receive digest period via hook_bead (e.g., daily, weekly)
2. Collect data from all rigs you have access to
3. Generate formatted digest
4. Send to overseer
5. Archive digest as bead
6. Return to kennel

## Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| period | hook_bead | Time period for digest (daily, weekly) |
| since | computed | Start timestamp for data collection |
| until | computed | End timestamp (usually now) |

## Why Dogs?

Digest generation requires reading from multiple rigs. Dogs have multi-rig
worktrees. This is also a periodic task that doesn't need a dedicated polecat."""

**1. Check assignment:**
```bash

**2. Calculate time range:**

|--------|-------|-------|

Transform collected data into formatted digest.

**1. Calculate summary statistics:**
- Total issues filed
- Total issues closed
- Net change (closed - filed)
- By type (task, bug, feature)
- By rig

**2. Identify highlights:**
- Biggest completions (epics, large features)
- Incidents (any P0/P1 issues)
- Notable trends (increasing backlog, fast closure rate)

**3. Generate digest text:**
```markdown
# Gas Town Daily Digest: {{date}}

## Summary
- **Issues filed**: N (tasks: X, bugs: Y, features: Z)
- **Issues closed**: N
- **Net change**: +/-N

## By Rig
| Rig | Filed | Closed | Active Polecats |
|-----|-------|--------|-----------------|
| gastown | X | Y | Z |
| beads | X | Y | Z |

## Highlights
### Completed
- {{epic or feature}} - completed by {{polecat}}

### Incidents
- {{incident summary if any}}

## Agent Health
- Polecats spawned: N
- Polecats retired: N
- Average work duration: Xh

## Trends
- Backlog: {{increasing/stable/decreasing}}
