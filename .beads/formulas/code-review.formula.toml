# Code Review Convoy Formula
#
# A convoy-style formula that spawns multiple polecats in parallel,
# each focusing on a different review aspect. Results are collected
# and synthesized into a unified review.
#
# Usage:
#   gt formula run code-review --pr=123
#   gt formula run code-review --files="src/*.go"

description = """
Comprehensive code review via parallel specialized reviewers.

Each leg examines the code from a different perspective. Findings are
collected and synthesized into a prioritized, actionable review.

## Legs (parallel execution)
- **correctness**: Logic errors, bugs, edge cases
- **performance**: Bottlenecks, efficiency issues
- **security**: Vulnerabilities, OWASP concerns
- **elegance**: Design clarity, abstraction quality
- **resilience**: Error handling, failure modes
- **style**: Convention compliance, consistency
- **smells**: Anti-patterns, technical debt

## Execution Model
1. Each leg spawns as a separate polecat
2. Polecats work in parallel
3. Each writes findings to their designated output
4. Synthesis step combines all findings into unified review
